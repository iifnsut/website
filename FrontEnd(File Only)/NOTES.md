2.  Use Bootstrap as much as possible
3.  Proper commit messages
4.  Make reusable code
5.  Use Tailwind breaking points
6.  Use camel case for naming files and folders and in JS
7.  Use IDs for JS and use hyphen-delimited strings to name them
8.  Use classes for css and use hyphen-delimited strings to name them
9.  Follow the BEM convention
10. Always put code to first-branch (no need to fork)
11. Use the code that has been already uploaded if possible, modify it if it doesn't mess up the previous code.
