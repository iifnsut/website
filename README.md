## Notes for the NSUT backend Developer
### Practice to Follow -
1. **Never Upload the environment variable or sensitive information in the GitHub**.
2. Comment the code with necessary information may required by others or yourselves latter.
3. Commit and Push the code with proper message so other can understand as well.
4. Use the given file structure to make code more modular so that it may be reusable in future.
## Running the code :
Plese fetch the latest code prior to the development and install the required dependence. The .eve file will be provided separately for the development. 
```npm run dev``` will automatically run server.js in nodemon. Use the following command to run the code.
```
cd BackEnd
npm install
npm run dev
````
